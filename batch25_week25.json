They offered valuable Mentorship [导师制度] and helped me weigh the pros and cons carefully. I felt very Appreciative [感激的] of their support and patience during that stressful time. The result was excellent, and I am now happily studying computer science, a field I truly enjoy every day and see a great future in.",

He is always asking questions and observing how people do things effectively to improve himself. He has learned many skills, from cooking to coding, just by being curious and open-minded. I think this is a good quality because it shows humility and a desire for self-improvement.
