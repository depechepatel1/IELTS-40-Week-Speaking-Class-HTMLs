        "model_answer": "I would absolutely love to go on a motorcycle trip along the beautiful coast with my best friend. We would ride from the northern beaches down to the southern cliffs, stopping at small towns. I choose a motorcycle because it feels more Spontaneous [随性的] and exciting than driving a car. It would allow us to really feel the wind and smell the salty ocean air as we travel. Riding a motorcycle gives a unique perspective of the scenery that you miss inside a car, making the journey much more memorable and vivid.",

I was stuck at the airport for over six hours with hundreds of other passengers. While waiting, I read a book and chatted with other stranded travelers to pass the time. I felt frustrated and anxious at first, but eventually accepted that it was out of my control and tried to stay calm and positive. It was a valuable [宝贵的] lesson in patience that taught me to handle unexpected travel disruptions better.",
