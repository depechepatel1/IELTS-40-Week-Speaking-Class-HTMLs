However, it can get <b>Overcrowded [拥挤的]</b> on holidays. I sometimes just go <b>Window shopping [只逛不买]</b> when I have no money. It is a great place to hang out with friends.

Although it is Overcrowded [拥挤的], I love it because the street food is delicious and Affordable [负担得起的] for students. You can find many Trendy [时髦的] accessories there too. It is more interesting than just Window shopping [只逛不买] in a mall. I am a Bargain hunter [专门买便宜货的人] and often haggle for lower prices. It is a Convenient [方便的] place to eat dinner after class. The vendors are very friendly and energetic. It is a unique cultural experience that represents our city's spirit.",

It is never Overcrowded [拥挤的], so shopping there is relaxing. It is a Convenient [方便的] location near our university. We went there to Shop till you drop [疯狂购物] last Saturday. The brand is becoming very Influential [有影响力的] locally. It was a great find because the quality is excellent and the style is perfect for her.",
