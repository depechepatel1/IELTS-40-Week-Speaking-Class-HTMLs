# CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: STRICT ADHERENCE REQUIRED
This prompt has been updated to address specific quality control failures. You must follow every instruction below with forensic accuracy.

## 1. Task Overview
You will process provided JSON/TXT curriculum data to generate high-quality HTML lesson materials.
Input Files: `Curriculum 0 final.txt`, `vocab_plan.txt`, `homework_plan.txt`.
Template File: `Week_2_Lesson_Plan.html`.

**Goal:** Create an HTML file for each week that is ready for PDF conversion.

## 2. Dynamic Lesson Planning (Teacher Plan)
**Requirement:** The "Teacher Lesson Plan" section on Page 1/3 must NOT be generic. It must dynamically reflect the specific content of that week.
*   **Topic Title:** Must match the week's topic (e.g., "Family", "Travel", "Technology").
*   **Learning Objectives:**
    *   Do NOT use generic text like "Describe a friend".
    *   MUST refer to the specific subject (e.g., "Describe a family member", "Discuss the impact of AI").
*   **Bilibili Search Term:**
    *   Do NOT use "IELTS Friendship" for every week.
    *   Generate a specific search query: "IELTS [Topic Name] Speaking".
*   **Differentiation:**
    *   Do NOT use generic advice.
    *   Provide specific sentence starters relevant to the topic (e.g., for "Travel": "I would love to visit..." for Band 5).

## 3. Vocabulary Lists (Lesson 1 and Lesson 2)
*Requirement:** Inject the week [X] vocabulary and idiom lists provided in the vocab_plan.txt file into the week [X] Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 vocabulary tables. 
*   **Idiom Example Sentence:** An example idiomatic sentence, which is provided in the vocab_plan.txt, must be placed in a new line spanning the width of the vocabulary table, below each idiom.
  * Do NOT add a new line below vocabulary words in the vocabulary tables. 

## 4. Mind Map Formatting (Student Handout - Part 2)
**Requirement:** The visual Mind Maps (Spidergrams) must be formatted using the same code as in 'Week_2_Lesson_Plan.html'.

*   **Central Node:**
    *   Do NOT use generic labels like "Topic A" or "Topic B".
    *   Extract Topics for all 3 Mind Maps from Week [X} in file 'Curriculum 0 Final.txt' 
    *   Extract a **specific keyword** from the question (e.g., if the question is "Describe a success", the node must say "SUCCESS" or "ACHIEVEMENT").
*   **Quadrants:**
    *   Do NOT use generic prompts like "Point 1".
    *   Use shortened versions of the **specific bullet points** provided in the curriculum data and give 2 one word suggestions (e.g., 'What their personality is'...  Should be shortened to 'Personality: Kind/Strong', ).
    *   Place these shorter bullet points in the outermost corners within the mindmap quadrant boxes to look balanced.  
    *   **Font Size:** font-size: 0.75em to ensure text fits without overflowing.

## 5. Part 2 Model Answers
**Requirement:** Formatting must be precise.
 *   **CRITICAL:** All sentences MUST start with a **blue highlighted transition phrase** (e.g., `<span class="highlight-transition">This is because</span>`).
*   If the source text does not have this, you **MUST INJECT IT**.
For all injected new text not in the Curriculum 0 final.txt model answers, rewrite that model answer from scratch using your AI capabilities to ensure quality.    
*   Keep *strict* word count limits for all new model answers that you create from scratch: Part 2 Model Answers are between 90 and 110 words. Part 3 model answers are between 50 and 70 words. 

## 6. Part 3 Model Answers (O.R.E. Method)
**Requirement:** Structure and formatting must be precise.
*   **Structure:** Opinion (Op), Reason (Re), Example (Ex).
*   **Format:** 
* The first 'Opinion' sentence must be preceded by the (Op) badge `<span class="badge-ore bg-o">Op</span>`
* The first 'Reason' sentence must be preceded by the (Re) badge `<span class="badge-ore bg-r">Re</span>`
8 The first 'Example' sentence must be preceded by the (Ex) badge `<span class="badge-ore bg-e">Ex</span>`

*   **Missing Transitions Fix:**
    *   **CRITICAL:** All sentences inn All model answers MUST start with a **blue transition phrase** (e.g., `<span class="highlight-transition">This is because</span>`).
    *   If the source text does not have this, you **MUST INJECT a natural IELTS Band 7 level transitions using your AI capabilities**. Do not output a model answer where the (Op), (Re) or (Ex) badge is followed immediately by black text.
*   **Question Numbering:**
    *   **Fix:** Avoid double numbering.
    *   *Bad:* "Q1: Q1. What is..."
    *   *Good:* "Q1: What is..." (Strip the internal "Q1." from the text).
*   **Formatting Codes:**
    *   Opinion: `<span class="badge-ore bg-o">Op</span>`+ **BLUE TRANSITION**
    *   Reason: `<span class="badge-ore bg-r">Re</span>` + **BLUE TRANSITION**
    *   Example: `<span class="badge-ore bg-e">Ex</span>`+ **BLUE TRANSITION**
    *   3-Clause Sentence: `<span class="highlight-3clause">...</span>` (Red text).
