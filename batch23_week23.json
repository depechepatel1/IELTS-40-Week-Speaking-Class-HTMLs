        "model_answer": "I vividly remember playing hide-and-seek with my cousins during long summer holidays. We played it in my grandmother's large backyard, which had plenty of great hiding spots like trees and bushes. It was a simple game, but we loved the thrill of Interaction [互动] and the friendly fun to find the best place where no one could see us. We had to be clever and quiet. I enjoyed it deeply because it was pure fun and allowed us to be creative with our strategies. Those moments are some of my most Precious [珍贵的] memories of childhood innocence.",

        "model_answer": "LEGO sets are incredibly popular with children today all over the world. They are popular because they encourage Creativity [创造力] and allow kids to build anything they can imagine, from castles to spaceships. I think they are excellent Educational [有教育意义的] toys because they help with Cognitive [认知的] Development [发展] and complex problem-solving skills effectively. Compared to my simple wooden blocks from the past, modern LEGOs are much more detailed and colorful. However, both serve the same purpose of sparking a child's imagination and are Durable [耐用的] enough to last for years of active play. They are truly timeless.",
