Parents spend years trying to <b>Instill [灌输]</b> good values and morals in us, so seeing us succeed on our own is their greatest reward. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Unless</b></span> we show respect for their efforts by living responsibly, we cannot maintain lasting family peace or make them truly happy.</b></span>"

My father was the main <b>Breadwinner [养家糊口的人]</b> and worked very long hours for us, so I didn't want to cause him any extra stress. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Since</b></span> he was often tired, I did chores to help him relax and feel proud of my maturity.</b></span>"

As they say, <b>The apple doesn't fall far from the tree [有其父必有其子]</b>, meaning children reflect their parents' behavior. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>When</b></span> parents set a good example, children usually follow suit in society, which reduces crime and increases overall stability.</b></span>"

        "model_answer": "<span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Unquestionably, in contemporary society</b></span> success is about happiness, not just money or status. We want our <b>Flesh and blood [骨肉/亲人]</b> to be mentally healthy and safe rather than just rich. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Whereas</b></span> in the past parents wanted us to <b>Follow in someone's footsteps [继承衣钵]</b>, now they let us choose our own path.</b></span>"
