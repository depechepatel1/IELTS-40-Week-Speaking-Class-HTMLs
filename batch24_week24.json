To solve the problem, I borrowed a friend's computer and luckily managed to download a backup from the cloud just in time. My friend really helped Save the day [挽救局面] for me by lending me his device and helping me set it up quickly before class started.",

        "model_answer": "<b>[Opinion]</b> Equipment usually breaks due to normal <b>Wear and tear [磨损]</b> over an extended period of time. <b>[Reason]</b> Nothing lasts forever, and moving parts eventually degrade with constant use, friction, and heat. <b>[Example]</b> A car engine, for instance, needs regular maintenance or it will surely fail one day unexpectedly. <b>[Extension]</b> Proper care and servicing can extend the lifespan of any machine significantly, saving money.",

        "model_answer": "<b>[Opinion]</b> Nowadays, people tend to buy new things due to the pervasive <b>Throwaway culture [用完即弃的文化]</b> we live in. <b>[Reason]</b> It is often cheaper and easier to replace an item than to pay for expensive repairs. <b>[Example]</b> Fixing a smartphone screen can cost almost as much as buying a brand new phone. <b>[Extension]</b> This behavior is unfortunately bad for environmental <b>Sustainability [可持续性]</b> and global resource use.",
