I saw lions, the King of the jungle [丛林之王 (狮子)], and many majestic [雄伟的] elephants walking in herds. The animals were treated with respect and lived in their natural habitat, not in small cages. I felt amazed and Sincere [真诚的 (interest)] gratitude for the chance to see nature untouched. It was a Fascinating [迷人的] experience that changed my view on wildlife conservation [保护] forever. The open space was breathtaking and unforgettable for me.",
