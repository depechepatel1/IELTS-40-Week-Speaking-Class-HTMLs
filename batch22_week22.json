It sells traditional pastries and modern cakes that are famous locally. Everyone from students to elderly people goes there because the quality is consistently Exceptional [杰出的 (service)].

Even facing Competition [竞争] from big chains, it remains Prosperous [繁荣的] because the owner knows how to Run the show [掌管] effectively and keep customers happy.
