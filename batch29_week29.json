I respect him because he showed true Integrity [正直] even when no one was watching him do it. He taught me that being Forgiving [宽容的] and honest [诚实的] makes you a better person and earns respect from everyone around you. His example has guided me in my own life choices many times.",

        "model_answer": "<b>[Opinion]</b> Generally, yes, forgiveness helps resolve <b>Conflict [冲突]</b> peacefully and restores harmony in relationships. <b>[Reason]</b> Holding a grudge only hurts yourself in the long run and damages relationships unnecessarily. <b>[Example]</b> Choosing to <b>Bury the hatchet [言归于好]</b> allows everyone to move forward positively. <b>[Extension]</b> However, trust may take a long time to rebuild fully after a serious betrayal.",

Social harmony often depends on these small, harmless untruths.",
