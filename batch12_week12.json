The streets were <b>Unfamiliar [不熟悉的]</b> and very crowded with people. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Since</b></span> we had no internet map, we started <b>Go around in circles [原地打转]</b> for an hour.</b></span> I felt quite <b>Panicked [惊慌失措的]</b> because it was getting dark and cold. Thankfully, a <b>Helpful [有帮助的]</b> local student stopped and showed us the way to the station. I was so <b>Relieved [如释重负的]</b> to arrive at our hotel <b>Safe and sound [安然无恙]</b>. It felt like a <b>Lost cause [注定失败的事]</b> at first, but we made it back.<br><br><b>Brainstorming Ideas:</b><br>- Place: Tokyo / Forest<br>- With: Friend / Alone<br>- Felt: Scared / Tired<br>- How: Map / Ask"

        "model_answer": "<span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>I wish to talk about</b></span> Google Maps, which is a highly <b>Versatile [多功能的]</b> tool on my phone. I use it daily because the city streets are often <b>Unfamiliar [不熟悉的]</b> to me. It gives clear directions so I never feel <b>Disoriented [迷失方向的]</b> while driving. <span style=\"background-color: yellow;\"><b><span style=\"color: blue;\"><b>Because</b></span> it is <b>Compact [小巧的]</b> and accurate, I never have to <b>Go around in circles [原地打转]</b> anymore.</b></span> I like it because it keeps me <b>Safe and sound [安然无恙]</b> on the road.
